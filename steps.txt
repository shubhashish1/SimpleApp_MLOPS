1. Create an environment named wineq and acitvate that conda environment.
2. Create requirements.txt file with following requirements listed:
     .dvc
     .dvc[gdrive]
     .scikit-learn
     . pandas
    Now install the requirements by command pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Now let's create a README.md file and put all steps in that.
4. Now let's create a template file to create the project folder structure with name template.py
5. Put the templates code which are nothing but the dirs and files we want to create and run by command : python template.py
6. Create a folder named data_given where we will keep our data and also it can be used as our remote data repo.
7. put the winequality.csv file there.
8. Now initialize git and dvc and also push the data to dvc:
     .git init
     .dvc init
     .dvc add data_given/winequality.csv
     .git add .
     .git commit -m "first commit"
     .git branch -M main
     .git remote add origin https://github.com/shubhashish1/SimpleApp_MLOPS.git
     .git push -u origin main

     â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/shubhashish1/SimpleApp_MLOPS.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

9. Then we have to put all the necessary params in the params.yaml
10. Now let's create our first file in src to get the data in the name get_data.py
10. Now we have to specify all the stages that are needed to be performed for the project to run in the dvc.yaml
